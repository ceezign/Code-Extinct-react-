# 🧩 Code Extinct

Code Extinct is a fun twist on the classic Hangman game — built with Vite + React.  
You’ll be guessing letters to save programming languages from extinction. Every wrong guess wipes out one language from existence until only one remains... then it’s game over.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🎯 Letter Guessing Game: Guess letters to uncover the hidden word.  
- 💥 Extinction Mechanic: You start with 9 programming languages — each wrong guess wipes one out.  
- 🎉 Confetti Celebration: A colorful confetti drop when you guess the word correctly.  
- 🪦 Farewell Messages: Each time a language “goes extinct,” a random farewell message appears.  
- 🔁 New Game Button: Restart anytime and try to save all languages again.

## 🎮 How to Play

1. Click letters to guess the hidden word.  
2. You have 8 chances to make mistakes — the 9th language is your last survivor.  
3. Each wrong guess makes one programming language go extinct.  
4. Guess the word correctly to trigger confetti and save them all.  
5. Miss too many and watch your favorite languages vanish one by one.
